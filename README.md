# Data-Mining-Algorithm-Metric-Calculation

This project focuses on exploring and comparing machine learning models for product recommendation based on customer purchase history. The project involves data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. Three models are developed and evaluated: Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Convolutional Neural Network (Conv1D). Performance metrics such as True Positive Rate (TPR), Specificity (SPC), Precision (PPV), Accuracy (ACC), and others are used to assess the models' effectiveness. The results are analyzed to determine the best-performing model for product recommendation in a retail setting.
